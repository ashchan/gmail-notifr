## Yet Another Gmail Notifier ##

[Gmail Notifr](http://ashchan.com/projects/gmail-notifr) is written in MacRuby with these features:

* Support multiple accounts.
* Separate check and notification setting for each account.
* Preferred browser setting for each account.
* Support Google hosted account.
* Check mail at a specified interval.
* Growl &amp; sound notifications.
* Small &amp; fast. *
* Sparkle automatic updates.
* No background daemon processes installed as Google's official notifier.
* Open Source &amp; free!

_* MacRuby is private framework on Lion, Gmail Notifr needs to embed the framework so the final size is kind of 'big' comparing to RubyCocoa version. Memory usage is bigger (30MB+) due to the same reason._

## Requirements ##

* Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) or higher
* An Intel 64-bit machine
* [MacRuby](http://macruby.com/) 1.0 (nightly build, 2011-07-22 or newer)
* [BridgeSupport](http://bridgesupport.macosforge.org/trac/wiki) Preview 3
